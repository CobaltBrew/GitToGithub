# Why you need to push file from working directory to Stage/intermediate 
# Reason is if you do not want all your filess to be tracked or all your files to be commited, things you want to ignore and want to  be tracked.\

# Working Directory > git add | Staging Area | > git commit | Git Repository

→ git checkout
→ git checkout chapter.txt # thsi is for specific file

# You can use .gitignore file to ignore files in your working directory.
# .gitignore file is a text file that contains a list of files or directories that you want
# to ignore from being tracked by Git.
